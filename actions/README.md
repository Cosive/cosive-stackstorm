# Cosive Stackstorm SecOps Helpers

This is a **Beta** pack of tools we developed while preparing our Security Orchestration training. There is still a bit to do in terms of input validation and error handling but they hopefully serve as a basis for some functionality.
We welcome pull requests or feel free to lodge an issue if you have any ideas you'd like to see implemented.
